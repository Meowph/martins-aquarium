<li>Add heated freshwater
If your tank has heated water, you can add heated freshwater to correct for water loss through evaporation</li><br/>
<li> water
For the first few months, you should replace 10&#45;25% of the water weekly. You can use a gravel or sand siphon to access the deeper layers of the substrate</li><br/>
