      <h4>Saltwater aquariums require more maintenance than freshwater aquariums. Here are some tips for keeping your saltwater tank clean and at the right salinity:</h4>
<h5>Check salinity
Use a refractometer or hydrometer to regularly test your tank's salinity and specific gravity levels. This will help you identify any shifts that need to be corrected.
<b></b>
Add heated freshwater
If your tank has heated water, you can add heated freshwater to correct for water loss through evaporation.
Change water
For the first few months, you should replace 10â€“25% of the water weekly. You can use a gravel or sand siphon to access the deeper layers of the substrate.
Clean the tank
Vacuum the bottom of the tank to remove sediment, and scrub algae away. You can also clean the cover glasses, lighting, and acrylic shield.
Test other water quality
Check the pH, alkalinity, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels of the water.
Inspect filter media and pumps
Make sure each filter and pump is operating correctly.</h5>
