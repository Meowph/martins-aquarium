    <h4>Tank Maintenance and Cleaning Tips</h4>
<li>Check salinity
Use a refractometer or hydrometer to regularly test your tank's salinity and specific gravity levels. This will help you identify any shifts that need to be corrected </li><br/>
<li>Add heated freshwater
If your tank has heated water, you can add heated freshwater to correct for water loss through evaporation</li><br/>
<li> water
For the first few months, you should replace 10&#45;25% of the water weekly. You can use a gravel or sand siphon to access the deeper layers of the substrate</li><br/>
<li>Clean the tank
Vacuum the bottom of the tank to remove sediment, and scrub algae away. You can also clean the cover glasses, lighting, and acrylic shield</li><br/>
<li>Test other water quality
Check the pH, alkalinity, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels of the water</li><br/>
<li>Inspect filter media and pumps
Make sure each filter and pump is operating correctly</li><br/>
